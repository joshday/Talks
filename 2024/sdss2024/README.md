# sdss2024

This directory contains the Pluto notebooks for my "Julia for Data Science" short course at the 2024 Symposium on Data Science and Statistics (SDSS).

- When: Tuesday, June 4, 1:30pm - 5:30pm
- Symposium website: https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2024/
- Abstract:

> Julia is a relatively new language for technical and scientific computing. Its design offers greater speed and productivity over the more established languages in the data science space: R and Python.
>
> In this course—tailored to those with a familiarity of data science and programming in a high-level language such as R, Python, or MATLAB—you’ll learn Julia from the ground up, starting with the basics and ending with using the core packages in Julia’s data science ecosystem. Importantly, you’ll learn how Julia’s language features can change your thinking about how to approach solving problems. You’ll also learn how to ingest/clean tabular data, fit models, visualize data, and perform other analytics tasks using a variety of Julia packages.
